        "To sum it up, this program will apply core concepts of programming to create a functioning grading system that includes function definitions, conditional statements, and mathematical operations. Because the program was structured into modular functions, readability and maintainability are improved to make it easier to modify as needed in the future. This program also supports the handling of user input and the presentation of formatted output. It therefore provided us with hands-on experience in Python programming, which greatly enhanced our capacity to develop applications that are well-structured and practical.\n"
